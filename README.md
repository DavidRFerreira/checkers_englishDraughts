Implemention of the American Checkers game (also known as English Draughts) using the C++ language. </br>
To develop this game it was used Visual Studio 2019 as the IDE. It is built as a console application.</br>

*** Disclaimer:</br>
This was the first object-oriented programming project I built when I was learning it's basics concepts. Because of this, there's a lot of room for improvement and future work.</br>
The code was written originally in portuguese, but since then I translated it to english.</br>

*** Features:</br>
I'm going to name some features that are built on this code:</br>
(1) The game implemented follows the american/english rules. All the rules and game mechanics are fully supported, such as crowning and forced capture. Invalid input will be rejected and player will be requested to input again.</br>
(2) You can choose to play in two different modes:</br>
(a) real player vs. real player.</br>
(b) real player vs. bot (the bot isn't very smart. It just randomly chooses a valid move).</br>
(3) The game is automatically saved in text files (.txt). You can always finish a game later (the program is capable of reading a saved game from text files).</br>
